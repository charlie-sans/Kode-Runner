# Kode-Runner

Welcome to **Kode-Runner**, an interactive code environment developed by **Finite**! Kode-Runner is a simple yet powerful tool that allows you to run code in various languages and view the output in real-time. It's perfect for testing code snippets or running scripts.
## What is Kode-Runner?

Ever wondered if you could write code directly inside **Resonite** and have it just work? Now you can—with **Kode-Runner**!

Kode-Runner is a hardware/server duo, developed by **Finite**, that allows you to run programming languages like Python, C, and C++ directly within Resonite. It features a fully interactive terminal, enabling you to run any code you wish.

While Docker is typically safe and isolates your code in a secure environment, please be aware that security can depend on how you use it—after all, you're essentially running a full computer inside another operating system (Windows or Linux).

The Kode-Runner server is located at `runner/main.py`, and it provides a streamlined experience for coding and testing within Resonite.

## Features

- **Multi-language Support**: Run code in Python, C, C++, and more.
- **Real-time Output**: See results instantly as you run your code.
- **Interactive Terminal**: Use a fully interactive terminal for real-time input and output.
- **Safe and Isolated Environment**: Code execution happens within a secure Docker container.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive to use, even for beginners.
- **Open Source**: Free to use and contribute to!

## Setup and Usage

### 1. Cloning the Repository
First, clone the repo and navigate to the `runner` directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/charlie-sans/Kode-Runner.git
cd runner
```

### 2. Running Kode-Runner
Run the main script on a Linux system or through WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux):
```bash
python3 lib/main.py
```

Once Kode-Runner is set up, spawn **Code from Charlie's public folder** inside a world in **Resonite**. Hit the purple button to connect to the server.

When you hear the `tada.wav` sound, you are successfully connected and can start running code.

### 3. Running Code
- **Type Code**: Type your code directly into the main code box.
- **Import Files**: Drop one of the demo code files into the import area under the left monitor.
- **Run Code**: Click the green run button in the top right corner of the window.
- **View Output**: Output will appear in the output window on the left monitor.

### 4. Rebuilding the Docker Container
If your Docker container gets destroyed, you can rebuild it by running:
```bash
docker build -t runner .
```
This will rebuild the container, and you can start the server again.

## FAQ

### What is Kode-Runner?
**Kode-Runner** is a hardware/server duo, developed by **Finite**, that allows you to run various text-based programming languages (Python, C, C++, etc.) inside **Resonite**.

### How does it work?
Using WebSockets and a Python server, Kode-Runner executes code inside a Docker container and streams the output back to the client in real-time. This provides a fully interactive terminal experience within the Resonite environment.

### Is it safe?
Kode-Runner runs code in an isolated Docker container for safety and performance. However, since you are effectively running a full computer inside another operating system, there is potential risk, especially when running untrusted code. Always use caution.
