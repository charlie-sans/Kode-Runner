What is Kode-Runner?

Have you ever wanted to execute text-based code inside Resonite? Now you can!

Kode-Runner is a hardware/server solution that allows you to run languages like Python, C, and C++ within Resonite. It includes features like real-time output and a fully interactive terminal.

Kode-Runner uses a Docker container to ensure safety and performance while running your code.
How Does It Work?

We utilize WebSockets and a Python server to execute code inside a Docker container and send the output back to the client in real-time. This setup allows for streaming a terminal to the client, providing a fully interactive coding experience.
